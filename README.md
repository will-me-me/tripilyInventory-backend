## Overview

The Triply backend is designed as a set of microservices to support an e-commerce platform. It includes services for handling orders and inventory management, among other functionalities. Each service communicates through RESTful APIs and uses PostgreSQL as the database.

## Microservices

### Order Service

The Order Service manages customer orders. It allows creating, updating, and retrieving orders.

#### API Endpoints

- **Create Order**: `POST api/orders`
- **Update Order Status**: `PATCH api/orders/:id/status`
- **Get All Orders**: `GET api/orders`
- **Get Order by ID**: `GET api/orders/:id`

#### Example JSON for Creating an Order

```json
{
  "customerId": "123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000",
  "items": [
    {
      "productId": "987e6543-e21b-12d3-a456-426614174001",
      "quantity": 2
    }
  ],
  "status": "PENDING"
}
```

### Inventory Service

The Inventory Service manages product inventory. It allows adding products, updating quantities, and retrieving product details.

#### API Endpoints

- **Add Product**: `POST api/inventory`
- **Update Product Quantity**: `PATCH api/inventory/:productId`
- **Get All Products**: `GET api/inventory`
- **Get Product by ID**: `GET api/inventory/:productId`

#### Example JSON for Updating Product Quantity

```json
{
  "quantity": 50
}
```

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- Git
- Node.js
- npm (Node Package Manager)
- Docker (for running the PostgreSQL container)

### Installation

1. **Clone the Git Repository**

   Open your terminal and run the following command to clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

   Replace `<repository-url>` with the actual URL of your Git repository.

2. **Start the Order Service**

   Navigate to the `order-service` directory:

   ```bash
   cd order-service
   ```

   Install the necessary dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

   Start the Order Service in development mode:

   ```bash
   npm run start:dev
   ```

3. **Start the Inventory Service**

   Open a new terminal window (to keep the order service running) and navigate to the `inventory-service` directory:

   ```bash
   cd inventory-service
   ```

   Install the necessary dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

   Start the Inventory Service in development mode:

   ```bash
   npm run start:dev
   ```

## API Endpoints

The API documentation for each microservice can be found within the service itself. Ensure to explore the routes using a tool like Postman or Swagger UI.
